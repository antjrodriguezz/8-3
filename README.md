To interpret user needs one should start with analysis. By asking for feedback from users and covering the modifications in the code. The specific inputs, as well as outputs for the system, should be identified. A user story is a the best way to express user needs. It's a tool used mostly in Agile development and for good reason, It can help understand the perspective of the end-user. It also helps in understanding what the user wants and creates a simple requirement description for it.

Developing programs can be approached by various project management strategies. Waterfall methodology is one such strategy. It helps in projecting the needs and adopting specific strategies. Other approaches are iterative, prototype, agile, and incremental. These approaches and processes offer unique ways to work with testing, planning, and integration.
